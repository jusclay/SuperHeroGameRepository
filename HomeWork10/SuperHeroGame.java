Purpose: This program provides the user with a list of superheroes. Each super hero has 3 abilities. These abilities are given Random values.
The random value determines rankind which decides the winner of the match. Game will have supero heros fight 7 consecutive times. Results of each matach will be sent to a .txt file.*/
